Welcome to the ARM-RT-DSP repository! This repository contains the ARM Real-Time DSP Extension Library, which provides a collection of optimized digital signal processing (DSP) algorithms for ARM-based platforms. The primary focus of the library is to facilitate real-time control applications on ARM processors in conjunction with the ARM DSP support library. The library complements the [ARM CMSIS-DSP](https://github.com/ARM-software/CMSIS-DSP) library.

**Please note:** This project is currently under active development and is not yet ready for use in production environments. The documentation, API, and other aspects may undergo significant changes as the project evolves.
