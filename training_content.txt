/////////////////////////////////////

I want to work on my Github project today.  This is an 
embedded C project that uses CUnit for unit testing.  The 
project consists of ARM DSP library that I am adding unit
tests to and publishing to GitHub.  I would like to make 
improvements as I go along.  Please pick a task to work on 
today.  Do not complete the task or write any code.

Here are the directories and files in the ARM-DT-DSP repository.
ARM-RT-DSP/
    ./README.md
    ./LICENSE.txt
    ./Makefile
    ./training_content.txt
    ./docs/
        ./usage_guide.md
        ./api_reference.md
    ./tests/
        ./suite1.c
        ./suite2.c
        ./test_main.c
    ./include/
        ./arm_rt_dsp.h
        ./common.h
    ./src/
        ./arm_rt_dsp.c
        ./common.c

Here is my status journal for the project:
6/19 - Fixed most test failures; four ADC-related tests in Suite 3 remain.
6/19 - Added draft unit tests for limit and check delta functions.
6/19 - Added draft unit tests for mul, min, max, and adc functions.
6/14 - Identified test failures and low coverage areas.
6/14 - Added test coverage measurement to makefile.
6/14 - Cleaned up git repository and learned about git pull requests.
6/3 - Renamed acc15_t to acc16_t and acc31_t to acc32_t project-wide.
6/3 - Added content to the api_reference.md and usage_guide.md files.
5/21 - Added hysteresis and check delta functions to arm_rt_dsp.h/c.
5/21 - Added continuous integration with Github actions.
5/21 - Updated README.md.
5/21 - Added some test cases for a ramp function.
5/21 - Fixed VS Code c_cpp_properties.json file to include the include directory.
5/20 - Added suite2.c with unfinished ramp function tests.
5/20 - Added custom ramp functions to the arm_rt_dsp.h file.
5/20 - Added custom ramp functions to the arm_rt_dsp.c file.
5/20 - Removed unrelevant comments.
5/20 - Investigated automated unit tests on ARM dev boards.
5/19 - Published ARM-RT-DSP to Github private repository and setup VS Code.
5/17 - Added custom DSP types and functions to arm_rt_dsp.h.
5/16 - Added arm_rt_dsp.h and common.h to the project.
5/15 - Created ARM-RT-DSP project in VS Code and added CUnit tests.

Here is a list of tasks that need completing.
1. Add CUnit tests for functions that are not covered.
2. Investigate failed CUnit tests.
3. Investigate running unit tests on ARM dev boards.
4. Refine documentation.
5. Add more custom DSP capabilities.
